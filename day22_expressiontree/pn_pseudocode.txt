parse (reference to string expression) returns int
	// expression is a string of words separated by spaces
	// expression cannot be empty
	// Only legal expressions are handled

	Remove first word in expression
	First = removed word
	if (First is not an operator)
		return First; WE ARE DONE!
	else First is an operator, so ...
		int arg1 = call parse(expression)
		int arg2 = call parse(expression)
		return result of operation First on arguments arg1 and arg2
	WE ARE DONE!
