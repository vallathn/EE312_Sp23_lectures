1. The difference between references and pointers is that calling a function that takes references is cleaner, syntactically, than calling a function that takes pointers.
2. Assigning to a reference variable is like assigning to the variable at the address.
3. Scoping rules -- scope within {}
4. C++ -- may declare variables anywhere, as long as it is before they are used.
5. const -- says that the variable may not be changed.
6. constructor:
	automatically called
	this is implicit parameter; it is a pointer to uninitialized block of memory
7. destructor
	called when object goes out of scope
	or when delete <pointer of object created by new> is called
8.  new and delete
	new allocates memory, then initializes memory
	delete calls destructor, then frees memory.
